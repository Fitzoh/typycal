`typycal` -- A handy tool to make type-aware classes
====================================================

This lightweight library is for the developer who enjoys the assistance provided
by Python's type annotations.  It offers a simple, declarative means of
converting a plain Python dictionary or string object into a type-aware object,
with properties to access a defined set of keys.

Developers working with REST APIs or any data loaded as a dictionary can use
typycal to effectively design "contracts" with their code, and ideally end up
with more readable software

.. testsetup:: *

  import typycal

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``typed_dict``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's say you have a settings file sitting somewhere, and it's loaded into your
project as a dictionary (such as `json.load`, `yaml.safe_load`, etc...):

.. code:: json

    {
        "db": {
            "username": "maxwell",
            "password": "SECRET",
            "port": "5432",
            "use_ssl": false
        }
        "log_level": "DEBUG"
    }


...let's say this configuration gets real messy real quick.  It can be a
real pain to have to remember the names of all your keys for what
becomes a Python `dict`.  So, here's an easy way to wrap your project's
configuration in a type-aware object

>>> from typycal import typed_dict
>>> @typed_dict
... class DBConfig(dict):
...    username: str
...    password: str
...    port: int
...    use_ssl: bool

>>> @typed_dict
... class ProjectConfig(dict):
...     log_level: str
...     db: DBConfig

>>> settings = {
...     "db": {
...             'username': 'maxwell',
...             'password': 'SECRET',
...             'port': '5432',
...         },
...     'log_level': 'DEBUG'
... }
>>> config = ProjectConfig(settings)


>>> config.db.username == 'maxwell'
True

>>> config.db.port == 5432
True

See that?  Even though you passed a string for the port, because you explicity defined the type, it was cast for you!
Now, let's try to access a missing property

>>> config.db.use_ssl is None
True

Note, an AttributeError wasn't raised because by default, `typed_dict` will decorate your class so that any unset
values which you have declared a type for will be set to `None`  You can disable this as follows

>>> @typed_dict(initialize_with_none=False)
... class StricterConfig(dict):
...        foo: str
...        bar: int

>>> StricterConfig({'foo': 30}).bar
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
AttributeError: 'StricterConfig' object has no attribute 'bar'

This makes the object-like treatment of the `dict` behave closer to how Python would yell at you about accessing
missing object attributes.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``typed_str``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another handy thing this library gives you is a way to quickly validate a string with a regex, and then store the group
match values as attributes on the str, and access them.  Here's a (roughly) complete example


>>> model_pattern = r"([0-9]{4}) (Ford|Toyota) (.+)"

>>> from typycal import typed_str
>>> @typed_str(model_pattern, 'year', 'make', 'name')
... class CarModel(str):
...        year: int
...        make: str
...        name: str

>>> @typed_str(r'(?P<color>[A-Za-z]+) (?P<model>.+)')
... class Car(str):
...     color: str
...     model: CarModel

>>> my_car = Car('Brown 1985 Ford Crown Victoria')

Now we can get attributes for the matches!

>>> my_car.color == "Brown"
True

Nesting and types are honored as well!

>>> my_car.model.year == 1985
True
